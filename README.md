### CURRENT

- 🔭  Presentation of my project Findogs was great
- 🌱  I’m keep learning JavaScript, Css, Html, React, Next.js, PostgresQL ... anything about Web Development
- ⚡  Fun fact: I love exploring the natural beauty of our planet through bike rides along the coastline of the ocean or visiting the world’s most fascinating cities. Since childhood, I have cared deeply about animals. This has allowed me to develop a passion for the power of empathic communication and caring for others. I also have to admit, I am obsessed with pizza (one slice at a time).
